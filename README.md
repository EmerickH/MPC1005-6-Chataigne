# MPC1005/MPC1006 video players module for Chataigne

**This module allows you to control MPC100 series video players via RS232.**

Theses video players can easily be found on Aliexpress/Alibaba for a very decent price (compared to alternatives with the same functionalities), and allows you to play videos, photos and music on a HDMI output from an SD Card or USB key/hard drive.

They support automatic video start on boot, automatic looping, deportable hardware buttons to trigger videos and a lot more features that make them a very good solution to play videos on exhibitions and art installations.

### Setup the player to be controllable
To be able to control the player with RS232 commands, you must follow the instructions on the [manual](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/982827/Ims-Mpc1005.html) to place an "autoplay.txt" file on the root of your SD Card/USB

More documentation on this process comming soon in the wiki.
